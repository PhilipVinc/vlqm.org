# About

A workshop where researchers from the fields of variational learning, quantum
computing, quantum machine learning, machine learning for quantum systems, and numerical quantum physics are brought together in order to foster the sharing of ideas from the different fields.

## Representational Power
Understanding which states can be represented by variational models, like neural networks or quantum circuits, is a vital task to theoretically motivate variational methods. Furthermore, it is important to understand how factors such as width, depth and the type of parametrized building blocks of such architectures affect the accuracy of the solution.

## Symmetries
While respecting physical symmetries of quantum systems is of utmost importance, resorting to generic and flexible wave-function parametrization (such as Neural Network Quantum States) also comes at the cost of breaking these symmetries.
Recent work has shown that embedding symmetries into the wave-function ansatze tends to greatly improve both the accuracy by which one can represent a quantum system, as well as gain efficiency in its optimization.
In this pillar, we cover methods to embed symmetries into neural network quantum states and variational quantum circuits, and the close connection between these approaches.

## Optimization
Even when a variational model can represent the desired states in theory, in practice it is not always feasible to optimize the wave function and obtain suitable parameters. 
Several algorithms have been proposed to improve upon plain gradient descent. Recent examples are  Natural Gradient descent, Gauss-Newton and Riley-Newton, which have been generalized to quantum algorithms as well.

## Applications
The topic of variational learning is becoming increasingly relevant in condensed matter physics, quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and computer science. For example, state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods use neural-network-based variational models to approximate the electronic orbitals in molecules.
