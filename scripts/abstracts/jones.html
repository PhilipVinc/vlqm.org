    <p>Your favourite programming language (Mathematica, of course) just became favouriter! QuESTlink allows rapid hassle-free simulation of quantum circuits and noise channels, and now has a family of tools for evaluating variational quantities with ease. With a hardware-accelerated numerical simulator, analytic calulators, visualisation tools, and realistic hardware noise profiles, QuESTlink can prepare your entire research paper from the comfort of your Mathematica notebook.</p>
    
    <p>QuESTlink is free, open-source and requires no installation, so bring along your laptop and learn to accelerate your research workflow by a factor one thousand while I live code a family of quantum variational algorithms for dynamical simulation, chemistry minimisation, and recompilation.
