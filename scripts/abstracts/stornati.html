In variational quantum simulations and, more generally, quantum computing, it is essential to develop quantum circuits that are as expressive as possible. In this talk, I will present a method to study and optimize the expressivity of quantum circuits. This method aims to identify and, in principle, remove superfluous parameters in a parametric quantum circuit. I will also show a hardware-efficient way to recognize those parameters.
