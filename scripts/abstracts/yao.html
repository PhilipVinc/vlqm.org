                    <p>Variational quantum algorithms stand at the forefront of simulations on near-term and future fault-tolerant quantum devices. Most variational quantum algorithms involve only continuous optimization variables, and we first demonstrate continuous policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The PG-QAOA is well suited for optimizing the variational parameters of QAOA in a noise-robust fashion. Secondly, the representational power of the variational ansatz can sometimes be significantly enhanced by adding certain discrete optimization variables, in particular, inspired by the counter-diabatic (CD) driving procedure. </p>

                    <p>We show autoregressive neural network based discrete optimization algorithms called CD-QAOA. The RL agent is trained to construct optimal sequences of unitaries for fast high-fidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime. Finally, we show that the hybrid discrete-continuous optimization problem in the generalized QAOA can be solved with a unified approach. We propose a new algorithm called MCTS-QAOA, which combines a Monte Carlo tree search method with an improved natural policy gradient solver to optimize the discrete and continuous variables in the quantum circuit, respectively. We find that MCTS-QAOA has excellent noise-resilience properties and outperforms prior algorithms in challenging instances of the generalized QAOA.</p>
