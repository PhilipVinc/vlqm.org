    <div> Supersymmetric quantum gauge theories are important mathematical tools in high energy physics. The wave function of such supersymmetric gauge theories is not known and it is challenging to obtain with traditional techniques such as Lattice Monte Carlo. We employ a neural quantum state ansatz based on normalizing flows for the wave function of a supersymmetric matrix model and use a variational quantum Monte Carlo approach to discover the ground state of the system.
