                <div> Capturing the dynamics of complex quantum systems with neural network ans√§tze has been plagued by several problems, one of which being stochastic noise that make the dynamics unstable and highly dependent on some regularization hyperparameters. We present an alternative general scheme that enables one to capture dynamics of quantum
systems in a stable fashion, provided the neural network ansatz is normalized. We benchmark the method using a recurrent neural network to simulate the quench dynamics of the transverse field Ising model. Finally, we apply the scheme to time-dependent quench dynamics by investigating the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model.
