    <div> For studies on quantum many-body ground states, I discuss application of variational Monte Carlo with Boltzmann machine to systematic ab initio calculations of 6 molecular solid compounds including a quantum spin liquid that exhibits dimensional reduction. For studies on spectroscopic data,  I talk about integrated analyses of angle resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and inelastic resonant X-ray scattering (RIXS) that were made possible by  a machine learning variational study. The central concept revealed through the two subjects is the fractionalization of particle.
