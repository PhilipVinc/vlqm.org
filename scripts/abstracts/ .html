                <div> Understanding how atomic nuclei emerge from the individual interactions among their constituents, protons, and neutrons is a long-standing challenge. Solving the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation is highly nontrivial because of the non-perturbative nature and strong spin-isospin dependence of realistic nuclear interactions. I will present a 
neural-network quantum state ansatz suitable to solve the nuclear many-body Schroedinger equation for a pionless effective field theory Hamiltonian. The binding energies and point-nucleon densities of nuclei with up to A=16 nucleons are benchmarked against accurate diffusion Monte Carlo and hyper-spherical harmonics results.
