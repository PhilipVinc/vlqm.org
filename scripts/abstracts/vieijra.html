    <div> In this talk, we will review two methods to incorporate continuous symmetries such as SU(2) in variational states.  The first approach consists of constructing basis states that transform as irreducible representations under the symmetry operations, and subsequently using conventional neural networks as a variational ansatz.  In the second approach, we introduce equivariance with respect to symmetries in the variational ansatz itself, resulting in a variational state where equivariance and variational freedom are interleaved.
