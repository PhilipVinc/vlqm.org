    <div> Takens embedding theorem, commonly used for the identification of classical dynamical systems, provides an upper bound for the number of measurements needed to uniquely identify the underlying dynamics. In this talk we will examine the theorem in the context of Quantum Process Tomography. In particular, we will see that Takens theorem can be used as a basis for an optimization based approach to reconstruct the Hamiltonian of the system, using as input time-delayed measurements of the evolution of a known initial state.
