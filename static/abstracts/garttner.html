        <p>Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of neural networks as variational ansatz functions for quantum many-body states. However, high-dimensional sampling spaces and transient autocorrelations confront these approaches with a challenging computational bottleneck. Compared to conventional neural networks, physical-model devices offer a fast, efficient, and inherently parallel substrate capable of related forms of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. </p>
        
        <p>I will report on recent results demonstrating the ability of a neuromorphic chip to variationally approximate highly entangled states as well as ground states of quantum spin systems.</p>
