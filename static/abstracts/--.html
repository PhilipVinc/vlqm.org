                <div> The current goal in quantum computing is to propose and demonstrate algorithms that offer advantages in solving problems of practical relevance. While the first candidate applications listed were chemistry, optimization, and machine learning, in this talk, I will present a new quantum approach to speed-up sampling. 
Sampling is a hard computational problem of concrete external significance in science or technology, and is typically performed by Monte Carlo methods.
We introduce a quantum-classical algorithm to speed-up the Metropolis algorithm. The proposal update is performed by a quantum computer, effectively querying the energy landscape in superposition[1,2], while the acceptance step is done classically. Overall we observe a cubic/quartic speed-up compared to the classical update schemes for frustrated Ising models.
We demonstrate the algorithm in real hardware and show that it is sufficiently noise resilient, such that it can be successfully implemented in machines before fault-tolerant era.[2]
This is a quantum-powered strategy to speed-up classical Monte Carlo. In the final part of the talk, I will also briefly mention challenges in combining quantum computing and quantum Monte Carlo instead.[3]
