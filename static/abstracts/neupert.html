    <div> Solving for the ground states of frustrated quantum magnets is a challenging problem for many-body numerical methods. The field is fueled by ever more detailed experimental data and the desire to identify quantum spin-liquid phases. I will show three examples of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg magnets that hold promise in this regard: the square-kagome (or Shuriken) lattice, the kagome lattice, and the three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice. By combining results from several methods, including variational Monte Carlo, multi-variable variational Monte Carlo, pseudo-fermion/Majorana functional renormalization group, density matrix renormalization group calculations, and exact diagonalization, we are able to make qualitative and quantitative statements about their phase diagrams. This way, we find dimer order in the pyrochlore as well as square-Kagome ground states, breaking spontaneously crystal symmetries.
