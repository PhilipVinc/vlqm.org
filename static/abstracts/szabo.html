<div class="cd-schedule-modal__event-info">
    <div> I will discuss the role of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in ans√§tze for variational Monte Carlo. I will focus on using neural quantum state architectures to represent ground states and low-lying excited states of quantum spin liquids. I will consider both group-convolutional networks and projected mean-field states, highlight good practices and challenges to reach state-of-the-art accuracy.
