    <div> CERN  launched its Quantum Technology Initiative in 2020 in order to investigate the use of quantum technologies in High Energy Physics (HEP). A three-year roadmap and research programme has been defined in collaboration with the HEP and quantum-technology research communities. In this context, initial projects have been set up at CERN in collaboration with other HEP institutes worldwide on Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning in particular. These projects,  are studying basic prototypes of quantum algorithms, which are being evaluated by LHC experiments for different types of workloads. This talk will provide an overview of recent results obtained by the different studies, including applications in areas ranging from accelerator beams optimization to data analysis and classification.
