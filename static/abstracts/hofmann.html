    <div> Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are exotic phases of matter which are characterized by high and long-range entanglement as well as the absence of spatial symmetry breaking and are relevant as a potential platform for topological quantum computing. Neural quantum states (NQS) have already shown promising results in the study of dynamics in two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Recent advances in NQS techniques, in particular improved insight into learning of complex sign structures as well as the introduction of group-convolutional neural networks as a flexible architecture to construct symmetry-aware NQS, have opened the path towards simulating systems capable of hosting QSL phases. In this talk, I will present our current efforts in applying NQS methods to a generalized Kitaev-Heisenberg model with applications to the physics of É‘-RuCl3, a well-known candidate material for the realization of QSL states.
