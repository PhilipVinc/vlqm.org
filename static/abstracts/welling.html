        <p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are an extremely general tool to describe continuous, local, causal processes in a broad spectrum of the sciences, including the Schrodinger Equation.</p>
        
        <p>In this talk I will first discuss how PDEs can be used as a method to describe the continuous limit of a CNNs and then briefly comment on to extend that to quantum fields. The latter happens to be very naturally mapped to an optical quantum computer. Next, inspired by how people have observed waves in brain activity, we use PDEs to describe the dynamics of hidden units' activities when predicting the future. </p>
