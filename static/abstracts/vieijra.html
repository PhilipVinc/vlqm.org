        <p>In this talk, we will review two methods to incorporate continuous symmetries such as SU(2) in variational states.</p>
        
        <p>The first approach consists of constructing basis states that transform as irreducible representations under the symmetry operations, and subsequently using conventional neural networks as a variational ansatz.</p>

        <p>In the second approach, we introduce equivariance with respect to symmetries in the variational ansatz itself, resulting in a variational state where equivariance and variational freedom are interleaved. </p>
