            We study the accuracy of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMBs) for the spin-1/2 J_1-J_2 model in one spatial dimension. The ground state of this model has a non-trivial sign structure for J_2/J_1>1/2, forcing us to use complex-valued RBMs.

            Two variational Ansätze are discussed: one defined through a fully complex RBM, and one in which two different real-valued networks are used to approximate modulus and phase of the wave function.

            We perform a systematic study on small clusters to evaluate the accuracy of these wave functions in comparison to exact results, providing evidence for the supremacy of the fully complex RBM. 
            Our calculations show that this kind of Ansätze is very flexible and describes both gapless and gapped ground states, also capturing the incommensurate spin-spin correlations and low-energy spectrum for J_2/J_1>1/2. Preliminary results for the frustrated Heisenberg model on the square lattice are finally shown.
