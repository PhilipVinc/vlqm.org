        <p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) constitute a class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that are envisioned as appropriate for noisy intermediate scale quantum processors. The majority of VQAs focus on quantum simulation, and particularly finding properties of many-body quantum systems, such as the ground state energies of complicated molecules. Other problems, such as optimization and machine learning are also being explored with this approach. </p>
        
        <p>In VQAs, the quantum processor is where the quantum state is variationally prepared and where measurements are made, while the classical computer performs optimization. </p>

        <p>After reviewing the concept of VQAs and their main aspects: state preparation, measurement, and optimization, I will highlight our work on designing efficient, compact ansatze both for many-body and for optimization problems.</p>
