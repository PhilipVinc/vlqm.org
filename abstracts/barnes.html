            The simulation of strongly correlated systems is one of the most exciting potential applications of quantum computers. There is hope that variational algorithms could enable the simulation of classically intractable problems on near-term devices, but this requires significant reductions in both variational circuit depths and measurement counts.

            I will discuss recent efforts to lower these resource demands by incorporating symmetries into variational ans√§tze, in the context of both adaptive and fixed-circuit algorithms.
