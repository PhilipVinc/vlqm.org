        <p>Ensuring effective informational processing within the Biological Neural Network (BNN) of workshop partecipants is known to be of fundamental importance. Previous works have shown that peak efficiency can be achieved by ensuring a constant stream of oxygen and glucose to the BNN.</p>
        <p>In this session, we will show that by providing proper amounts of high-quality, tasty food, peak efficiency can be restored in a BNN that is no longer operating optimally.</p>
