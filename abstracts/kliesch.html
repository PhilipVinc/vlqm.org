        <p>Many optimization methods for training variational quantum algorithms are based on estimating gradients of the cost function. Due to the statistical nature of quantum measurements, this estimation requires many circuit evaluations, which is a crucial bottleneck of the whole approach.</p>
        <p>We propose a new gradient estimation method to mitigate this measurement challenge. Within a Bayesian framework and based on the generalized parameter shift rule, we use prior information about the circuit in order to find the measurement setting that minimizes expected statistical and systematic estimation errors simultaneously. Then we demonstrate numerically that this approach can significantly outperform traditional gradient estimation methods. </p>
