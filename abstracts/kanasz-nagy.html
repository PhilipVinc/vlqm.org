            Tensor networks provide a natural representation of quantum data. The representation power and the optimal structure of these networks are well-understood in terms of quantum entanglement. Although tensor networks have often been often used to classify and compress classical datasets, their representation power in terms of the mutual information in these datasets is much less clear.

            In the talk, I will discuss our mutual information scaling analysis in image and text data. We find that in text, the mutual information scales as a power-law, with a close to volume law exponent, indicating that text cannot be efficiently described by MPS tensor networks. For images, the scaling is close to an area law, hinting at 2D tensor networks such as PEPS could have an adequate expressibility.
