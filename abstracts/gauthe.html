<p>Tensor networks provide highly successful ansatze for the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. Initially introduced in 1D with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), they have been extended to more complex network structures and beyond wavefunctions to thermal ensembles. </p>

<p>As physical models of importance typically display a combination of lattice symmetries and symmetries of elementary term in the Hamiltonian, we show how these two types of symmetry can be independently enforced at the elementary tensor level and how the resulting symmetric tensors allows to construct simple few-parameters wavefunctions. In a second time, we show how to implement both abelian and non-abelian virtual symmetries for any tensor network in a systematic and computationally efficient way, yielding huge gains in terms of memory use, computation time as well as numerical precision.</p>

<p>We illustrate symmetric tensor importance with Projective Entangled Pair States (PEPS) simulation of the Heisenberg spin-1/2 J1-J2 model on the square lattice at finite temperature, where implementing the full SU(2) spin symmetry showed to be crucial to prevent an unphysical symmetry breaking artifact from hiding key physical aspects.</p>
